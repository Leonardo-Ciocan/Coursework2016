\chapter{Professional Issues}

This project and all of its components abide by the Code of Conduct as detailed by the British Computer Society \cite{conduct} for legal and ethical reasons.

The usage of open source code has greatly accelerated the development of this project and has provided functionality that was outside my means to create in the time frame allocated to this project. As such , every library and instances of code used in this project that were not written by me are clearly stated. Code that is not marked as such can be assumed to written completely for this project.

Since this project revolves around real people in a collaborative setting it was paramount that extra care was put into ensuring the privacy and anonymity of the end users were respected and built into the platform. Minimal user collection is done as the application contains no ads and does not profit from selling the user's information. There are also information barriers to prevent malicious users from exploiting other user's information.
