\chapter{Introduction}
The rise of technology such as mobile devices has been sudden and unexpected compared to any other part of human history. While many industries have quickly adapted to the changes , education is one field where embracing technology is still underway. One of the most striking examples of how technology can improve education is the invention of the printer , which contributed greatly to literacy in developed countries going from 10\% to 80\% in a very short time \cite{printing}.

A number of other studies show that introducing technology in a learning environment can have a positive impact \cite{tech} and that there is a international movement to augment learning with technology \cite{tech2}.
Today , we live in a world where every student in developed countries has access to a electronic device - in fact , for subjects such as engineering and computer science , virtually every student has access to such a device \cite{laptop1} \cite{laptop2} . However , in university lectures , paper handouts are still used; their purpose is for the students to be able to test how well they understand the current concept being taught and for teachers to gauge the student's understanding of the subject and adjust their teaching schedule accordingly.

A digital replacement of these handouts has the potential to increase student engagement and minimise the friction of distributing , collecting and analysing data.Overall allow the overall turnaround time for the teaching process to be as small as possible.

\section{Motivation}
Handouts can ask a variety of questions ; they can have images , tables , formatted text and more. If a digital alternative is to replace this , it must be flexible enough to support a variety of question types. Further more , paper handouts allow the user to draw or express their answer in a number of ways  , this can be a disadvantage since the students could write invalid answers ( i.e select two answers in a single answer multiple choice question) however it also provides a lot of flexibility. A digital solution must solve both problems by providing flexible , tailored ways to express the questions and to answer them in a way that is valid and yet allow the user to express their creativity.

To account for this goal , the end product build will be tailored for computer science students. This is to showcase the features of the platform and allow for a focused development cycle that would prove the usefulness of a digital solution for this problem. Part of this tailoring will be a question type that let's students write their own code and have it executed and checked by the system.

The data visualisation part of this project provides a number of ways to explore novel ways to show the aggregated data in ways that is useful to the teacher and is tailored for each question type.

In section \ref{future} (Future work) it will be discussed how the system , once shown to work as intended , can be extended further and be tailored for all the subjects that make up higher education. This is because the project will be developed as a platform and make it so adding question types will be simple.


\section{Report structure}
The next section will be the background which will begin by exploring the keywords or concepts that are related to the project. It will also talk about the platform chosen for the project and solutions that already attempt to solve the problem we're exploring.

Afterwards , requirements for the project will be laid out - the report will explore how they were solved in a later Evaluation section.

The design section will explore the system from a architecture point of view , laying out the structure of the system. This will be later expanded on in the implementation section , where the internals of the system will be documented.

After some reflections on ethics , the conclusion will bring the report to an end with some thoughts on the project and plans for the future of the project.
