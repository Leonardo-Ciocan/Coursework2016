Technology has helped augment every field of society. However when it comes to education, technology is not yet being used to its full potential. One such example is the continued reliance on paper for things such handouts.

This report will explore a digital solution to replace handouts, exercise sheets and similar analogue means of testing student's knowledge. The purpose of this project will be to minimize the friction that exists when a single teacher teaches a large group of people by using technology by providing them with the tools to monitor the student's understanding of the lecture.
