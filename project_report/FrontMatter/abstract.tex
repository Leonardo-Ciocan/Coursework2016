In university settings, lecturers often teach classes of up to 200 students. Often they distribute papers to gauge the studentâ€™s understanding of the current material being taught. The distribution, collection and analysis of these materials makes it hard for the lecturer to evaluate which parts of the material the students need help with.
I have created a digital solution that helps the teacher get a better understanding of his students progress in real time.
